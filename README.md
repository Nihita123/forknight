## 🚨 Problem Statement

Open source is powerful — it builds the internet, fuels our frameworks, and gives us superpowers as developers.

But let’s be honest: contributing to open source often feels more like a chore than a challenge.  
You're not rewarded, recognized, or even remembered.

You might Push 5 commits, Fix 3 annoying bugs, Review 2 pull requests...  

And you get? 
No XP, No high-fives, No loot , Just digital silence :(

Meanwhile, Fortnite rewards you for showing up. Duolingo throws a party when you do 5 minutes of Spanish.  
Why doesn’t GitHub say “Nice work!” when you fix an issue that’s been open for 6 months?

The result?

💔 Developers burn out.  
🚪 Contributors leave after a few PRs.  
🧠 Talented devs stay hidden in GitHub’s shadows.

We’re developers too. We’ve been there.

That's the real bug.

That's what ForkNight is here to solve.
